# Gulf of Mexico Temperature Wind Change

## Project Description

In this project, I will investigate the effects of wind forcing on ocean temperature in the Gulf of Mexico. In particular, I will investigate the following scientific question:

How do winds affect ocean temperature in the Gulf of Mexico Current?

To investigate this question, I will construct a model domain encompassing the Gulf of Mexico and run my model simulation for one year in two experiments: a run with wind forcing and a run without wind forcing. The grid for my model will be located in the Gulf of Mexico, capturing key features such as the Loop Current and surrounding coastal regions. I will run my experiment during the year 2017, which is the most current year. I anticipate that the model with wind forcing will show more variability and cooler surface temperatures in certain regions compared to the model without wind, due to enhanced vertical mixing and surface heat flux changes.

<!-- 2017 experienced notable wind-driven variability according to NCEP reanalysis data ??-->

For initial conditions, I will use the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January 2017. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 5 model output. To analyze the results, I will create a time series of temperatures in the region near the Loop Current and investigate differences between the two experiments over time. For visualization, I will make a movie of temperature differences between the model with wind and without wind.
