# Arctic Ice-Free Day Prediction

## Project Description

In this project, I will investigate the timeline for the first ice-free day in the Arctic, defined as the first occurrence of sea ice area (SIA) falling below 1 million km². In particular, I will investigate the following science question:

*When will the Arctic first experience an ice-free day (with a SIA of 1 million km² or less)?*

To investigate this question, I will construct a model spanning of the Arctic Ocean and run my model from 2000 to 2050 to assess long-term trends in Arctic sea ice decline. The region of interest covers the entire Arctic Ocean. I will set up the model using the SEAICE, THSICE, and SHELFICE modules to accurately simulate the dynamics and thermodynamics of sea ice. 

I will use initial conditions derived from historical data and reanalysis products to ensure the model realistically represents the current state of the Arctic. The anticipated result is that under high-emission scenarios, the Arctic may reach an ice-free state during summer sooner than under low-emission scenarios. Additionally, it expects to have [The first ice-free day in the Arctic Ocean could occur before 2030 from Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54508-3).

For visualization, I will create movies of sea ice extent reduction changes in the Arctic daily with high and low emssion scenario.
