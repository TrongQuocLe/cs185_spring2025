# CS 185C Spring 2025

Welcome to my ocean modeling repository! This repo is designed to be an example for the CS 185C course taught at San Jos√© State University in Spring 2025.

There are two key directories in this repository: 

## homework
The homework directory is for storing, managing, and turning in weekly homework assignments

## project
The project directory for storing files for the final project in this course. The project directory will be created in week 8 and continually updated through the end of the course.
